The other two parcels are probably a bit of both and around $50 is reasonable to replace current earning potential.

Our council, Tweed Shire Council, is run by “green” mayor and 3 others who act unconscionably often. They have determined, without any consultation, that there is a koala connection through my major horticulture paddock that is clear if vegetation and had been clear for over 80 years. They can allocate wild life corridors, protected areas etc etc without any consultation with the land owner and in fact without ever telling the land owner who might find out if they submit a DA fir farm buildings, I was in a meeting where our mayor said when asked what would happen if people tried to sell the property that ‘we will inform the new owners’. I used to be interested in conservation and was about to plant 1 ha if koala trees but this council is sooooo unreliable, so divisive and so unconscionable in their conduct I refuse in any way shape or form to assist in their idiocy. They appear disinterested in any agenda but their own narrow minded idea about what should happen. They conduct “community consultation” because they have to but every single thing that doesn’t fit with their narrow minded agenda is placed in the “no further action” basket. The have no understanding of generating  jobs and futures except for assisting their supporters many of whom have never actually worked for a living."
